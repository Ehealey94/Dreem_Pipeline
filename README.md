# Dreem_Pipeline

This is a preprocessing pipeline for dreem data files.

It also contains some additional analysis options, such as calculating wpli, frontal alpha asymmetry and slope/offset

To run this script you need to download and add to your matlab path:
- eeglab 
- Sri's manage_badTrials 
- to calculate slope/offset: the matlab wrapper for fooof tools (see https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/auto_tutorials/index.html)
