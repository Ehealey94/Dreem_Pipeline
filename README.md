# Dreem_Pipeline

This is a preprocessing pipeline for dreem data files. Start out with the _master_ script, which rules them all.

The pipeline also contains some additional analysis options, such as calculating wpli, frontal alpha asymmetry and slope/offset

To run this script you need to download and add to your matlab path:
- EEGLAB https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download.php 
- Sri's manage_badTrials https://github.com/SridharJagannathan/manage_badTrials
- to calculate slope/offset: the matlab wrapper for fooof tools (see https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/auto_tutorials/index.html)
